## Weather App

Hello! Welcome to my weather app. I, jemychen, created this weather app from scratch with a third party API during my time in bootcamp. During my time there, there were not much opportunity to learn and utilize API's. However, I really wanted to learn to use API's and decide to make my module 4 project with an API. However, since this was a solo project for myself it was a lot more difficult than I anticipated. With my introduction out of the way let me give a brief summary on how this application work.

## How To Use The Weather App

The app itself is very simple. As long as you're on the weather-app-frontend page of your text editor, you can boot up the application with `yarn start`. This starts the app through from your default browser. From there, you can easily type out cities for their temperature and weather. Looking up cities that are popular will return their result. So looking up 'Tokyo' will return it as 'Tokyo, JP', alongside the weather and temperature. The third party weather app, however, does not look up towns or villages that are very specific. An example: 'Madrid, NY' will not return any results as Madrid from Spain is the most well known. Looking up 'Madrid' returns 'Madrid, ES' for Madrid, Espana.

Currently there is no backend portion for this project. Not because I do not want to, but rather I have no idea how a backend would look for a project as simple as this.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
